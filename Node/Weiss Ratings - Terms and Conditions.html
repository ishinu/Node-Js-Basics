<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Terms and Conditions of Service</strong></p>
<p>Weiss Ratings, LLC (Weiss Ratings) is strictly a financial research publishing firm (a publisher) and does not provide individual investment advice to its subscribers. Weiss Ratings is not a registered investment adviser or a registered securities broker/dealer.</p>
<p>For purposes of these Terms and Conditions of Service, the term "Weiss Ratings" (also "we," "us") includes Weiss Group, LLC (Weiss Group)&nbsp;and its related companies, subsidiaries, divisions and brands.</p>
<p>The information we publish is based on Weiss Ratings' and/or our editors' opinions plus our statistical and financial data and independent research. Although we make every effort to provide the most accurate and updated information possible, our information cannot take into consideration your personal finances and goals, and therefore is not intended to be used as customized recommendations to buy, hold, or sell securities, or to engage in any trading strategy, or that an investment strategy is suitable for any specific person. Such recommendations may only be made by a personal adviser or broker you select.</p>
<p>To the extent that any of the content published on the Site may be deemed to be investment advice or recommendations in connection with a particular security, such information is impersonal and not tailored to the investment needs of any specific person. You understand that an investment in any security is subject to a number of risks and that discussions of any security published on the Site will not contain a list or description of relevant risk factors.</p>
<p>Trading in various instruments (including, without limitation, stocks, options, warrants, ETFs, mutual funds, precious metals, commodities, cryptocurrencies and bonds) is considered speculative and involves risk of loss and volatility. Although our editors and publications make every effort to protect your principal, you can lose money. Therefore, they are not intended for all of your funds. If your goal for a certain portion of your funds is strictly capital preservation, we believe you should invest those funds in conservative investments such as short-term US Treasury securities or equivalent. For more information on prudent investing, also see the information available at the websites of the Securities and Exchange Commission at www.sec.gov and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority at www.FINRA.org. Any money you allocate to speculative investments should be strictly the money you can afford to risk without jeopardizing your daily life, and without negatively impacting your plans for education, retirement, or long-term care.</p>
<p>Most of the information we publish is derived from primary sources, including U.S. government agencies as well as the financial institutions or publicly traded companies we cover. We believe our data sources are accurate, but we do not verify their accuracy independently. Therefore, we cannot assure that the information is accurate or complete. Nor do we guarantee the success of any investment decision you may make using our data, information, or recommendations.</p>
<p><strong>Required Risk Disclosure Statement:</strong></p>
<p>Hypothetical performance results have many inherent limitations, some of which are described here. No representation is being made that any account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses like those shown in the hypothetical performance results. In fact, there are frequently sharp differences between hypothetical performance results and the actual results subsequently achieved by any particular trading program.&nbsp;One of the limitations of hypothetical performance results is that they are generally prepared with the benefit of hindsight. In addition, hypothetical trading does not involve financial risk, and no hypothetical trading record can completely account for the impact of financial risk in actual trading. For&nbsp;example, the ability to withstand losses or to adhere to a particular trading program in spite of trading losses are material points which can also adversely affect actual trading results. There are numerous other factors related to the markets in general or to the implementation of any specific trading program&nbsp;which cannot be fully accounted for in the preparation of hypothetical performance results and all of which can adversely affect actual trading.</p>
<p><strong>Acceptance of Terms and Conditions of Service:</strong>&nbsp;You represent that you have read and agree to be bound by the Terms and Conditions of Service ("Terms") for Weiss Ratings. You further agree to comply with U.S. law regarding the transmission of any data obtained from the Service (as defined herein) in accordance with these Terms, not to use the Service for illegal purposes, and not to interfere or disrupt networks connected to the Service.</p>
<p><strong>Weiss Ratings Alerts — SMS Texting:</strong>&nbsp;Users who have opted in to receive text alerts from Weiss Ratings will receive reminders, important updates, critical access links and bonuses. Users can opt-out of receiving text alerts at any time. Users are not required to opt-in to text alerts as a condition of purchasing any property, goods and services.</p>
<p><strong>Privacy Protection and Opt-In Policy:</strong>&nbsp;We do not contact customers or viewers unless requested to do so by those individuals requiring or requesting further information from us. For many of our Services, both paid and free, Weiss Ratings requires registration. Information is required for account set-up and to enable us to provide the maximum quality of service. Member contact information is used to send information about our company and promotional materials sent from Weiss Ratings. The only customers who will receive offers from organizations outside of Weiss Ratings are those who specifically "opt-in" to receive that information. Note that they can choose to "opt-out" of those distribution lists at any time.</p>
<p>Registrants are "opted out" of receiving future mailings regarding product updates and promotions by default in the registration process.</p>
<p><strong>Registration and Privacy:</strong>&nbsp;In order to gain access to portions of our Services, you must become a member by choosing a unique user name, member name and password, and supply us with true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself, as required on the registration page. We may refuse to grant you a user name and member name that is threatening, abusive, offensive, harassing, derisive, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, libelous, invasive of another's privacy, impersonates someone else, is or may be protected by trademark or proprietary rights law, or is hatefully, racially, ethnically or otherwise objectionable, or inappropriate, as determined by us in our sole discretion. In consideration of your use of our Services, you represent that you are of legal age to form a binding contract and are not a person barred from receiving the Services under the laws of the United States or other applicable jurisdiction. You also agree to maintain and promptly update your registration data to keep it true, accurate, current and complete.</p>
<p>Our policy with respect to the collection and use of your personal information is set forth in our&nbsp;<u><a href="https://weissratings.com/en/privacy-statement">Privacy Policy.</a></u> This Privacy Policy is hereby incorporated into these Terms by reference and constitute a part of this Agreement. Weiss Ratings reserves the right to modify the Privacy Policy at its sole discretion.</p>

<p>Social media platforms are places of public information exchange, and you should have no expectation of privacy when using them.

If you see an offensive or inappropriate post or comment on our Social Media Presence, you should report it to the operator of the applicable site or platform using the procedures they have established for that purpose.</p>
<p><strong>Independent Contracted Editors:&nbsp;</strong>Weiss Ratings is strictly a publisher of financial information. Neither Weiss Ratings nor any of its affiliated companies are registered investment advisers or broker/dealers. However, at times Weiss Ratings has agreements with independent editors who are or have acted in their own capacity as an investment advisor or broker outside the scope of their editorial responsibilities with Weiss Ratings.&nbsp;Any business relationship you may enter with an independent editor is not associated, condoned, affiliated or endorsed by Weiss&nbsp;Ratings. Any independent editor acting in their capacity as a registered adviser or broker is OUTSIDE the scope of their agreement and contracted responsibilities with Weiss&nbsp;Ratings. Subscribers should not view any of our publications as offering personalized legal or investment counseling.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Dispute Resolution by Mandatory Binding <br>Arbitration and Class Action Waiver</strong><strong>:</strong></p>
<p>PLEASE READ THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION CAREFULLY TO UNDERSTAND YOUR RIGHTS. EXCEPT WHERE PROHIBITED BY LAW, YOU AGREE THAT ANY CLAIM THAT YOU MAY HAVE IN THE FUTURE MUST BE RESOLVED THROUGH FINAL AND BINDING CONFIDENTIAL ARBITRATION. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY. THE RIGHTS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE IF YOU WENT TO COURT, SUCH AS DISCOVERY OR THE RIGHT TO APPEAL, MAY BE MORE LIMITED OR MAY NOT EXIST. YOU AGREE THAT YOU MAY ONLY BRING A CLAIM IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF (LEAD OR OTHERWISE) OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. YOU FURTHER AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE PROCEEDINGS OR CLAIMS OR OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING.</p>
<p>THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED. HOWEVER, AN ARBITRATOR CAN AWARD ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF AS A COURT (INCLUDING INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF OR STATUTORY DAMAGES), AND MUST FOLLOW THE TERMS OF THESE CONDITIONS OF USE AS A COURT WOULD.</p>
<p><strong>A. General: </strong>Arbitration is a manner of resolving a “Claim” without filing a lawsuit. “Claim” means any dispute between you, Weiss Ratings, or any involved third party relating to your account, your use of the Site, your relationship with Weiss Ratings, these Terms, or the Privacy Policy. This includes any and all claims that relate in any way to your use or attempted use of the products or services, and any act or omission by Weiss Ratings, or any third party related to your use or attempted use of the products or services. You, Weiss Ratings, or any involved third party may pursue a Claim. Weiss Ratings agrees to final and binding confidential arbitration should it have any Claims against you. Likewise, you agree to final and binding confidential arbitration should you have any Claims against Weiss Ratings. By agreeing to arbitrate, you waive the right to go to court and agree instead to submit any Claims to final and binding confidential arbitration. This arbitration provision sets forth the terms and conditions of our agreement to final and binding confidential arbitration and is governed by and enforceable under the Federal Arbitration Act (the “FAA”), 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16, as amended.</p>
<p><strong>B. Exceptions: </strong>Notwithstanding the foregoing, and as an exception to final and binding confidential arbitration, you and Weiss Ratings both retain the right to pursue, in small claims court, any claim that is within that court’s jurisdiction and proceeds on an individual (non-class) basis, including overdue account matters within the small claims court’s jurisdiction. Weiss Ratings will not demand arbitration in connection with any individual claim that you properly file and pursue in a small claims court, so long as the claim is and remains pending in that court. The following claims shall not be subject to final and binding arbitration and must be adjudicated only in the state or federal courts located in Florida: (i) an action by Weiss Ratings relating to the infringement or validity of our proprietary rights, including without limitation, trademarks, service marks, trade dress, copyrights, trade secrets, or patents; or (ii) an action by Weiss Ratings for temporary, preliminary, or permanent injunctive relief, whether prohibitive or mandatory, or other provisional relief, against you for breach or threatened breach of this Agreement. You expressly agree to refrain from bringing or joining any claims that are excluded from final and binding arbitration pursuant to this subsection “b” in any representative or class-wide capacity, including but not limited to bringing or joining any claims in any class action or any class-wide arbitration. Small claims matters may be filed in any small claims court with personal and subject matter jurisdiction over the parties. For all other matters excluded from final and binding arbitration by this subsection “b,” the parties consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the state and federal courts located in Palm Beach, Florida, and forever waive any challenge to said courts’ jurisdiction and venue.</p>
<p><strong>C. Required Pre-Dispute Procedures: </strong>We acknowledge and agree that before initiating any Claim against the other, we agree to first contact the other with a written description of the dispute, which shall include all relevant documents and information, and the proposed resolution. You may send the written description of any dispute you have with us by U.S. Mail to Weiss Ratings, Attn: Legal Department, 4400 Northcorp Pkwy Palm Beach Gardens, FL 33410-9998. Weiss Ratings will contact you by letter at the billing address you provided to us or at the email address you provided to us. You agree to negotiate with Weiss Ratings or its designated representative in good faith about your problem or dispute. If for some reason the dispute is not resolved within 60 days after receipt of the written dispute, we agree to the dispute resolution provisions below. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other term of this arbitration agreement, we will have the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in state or federal court located in Palm Beach County, Florida to enforce these Terms or prevent an infringement of a third party’s rights or our intellectual property rights, as stated in subsection “b” above. You hereby expressly consent to, and forever waive any challenge to, the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of said courts in such actions.</p>
<p><strong>D. Commencing Arbitration: </strong>You and Weiss Ratings agree to commence any arbitration proceeding within 1 year after the Claim arises (the 1 year period includes the required pre-dispute procedures set forth above) and that any arbitration proceeding commenced after 1 year shall be forever barred.</p>
<p><strong>E. Arbitration Location: </strong>If the amount in controversy is $500 or less, then the arbitration may be conducted by telephone or by written submissions. Otherwise, the arbitration shall be conducted in Palm Beach County, Florida unless Weiss Ratings otherwise agrees to arbitrate in another forum requested by you.</p>
<p><strong>F. Organization, Rules and the Arbitrator: </strong>We each agree that any and all Claims other than those exempted under subsection “b” above shall be submitted to final and binding confidential arbitration before a single arbitrator of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”). Either party may commence the arbitration process by submitting a written demand for arbitration with the AAA, and providing a copy to the other party, within the time period set forth in subsection “d” above. The arbitrator shall be selected by agreement of the parties or, if the parties cannot agree, chosen in accordance with Rules of the AAA. The arbitration will be conducted in accordance with the provisions of the AAA’s Commercial Dispute Resolutions Procedures, Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes, in effect at the time of submission of the demand for arbitration. The AAA’S Rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. The arbitrator shall have the exclusive and sole authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, construction, validity, applicability, or enforceability of these Terms, the Privacy Policy, and this arbitration provision. The arbitrator shall have the exclusive and sole authority to determine whether any dispute is arbitrable. The arbitrator shall have the exclusive and sole authority to determine whether this arbitration agreement can be enforced against a non-signatory to this agreement and whether a non-signatory to this agreement can enforce this provision against you or Weiss Ratings.</p>
<p><strong>G. Fees: </strong>Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA’s Rules. We will reimburse the fees charged by the arbitrator for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. Likewise, we will not seek attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. In all other respects, the parties shall each pay their own additional fees, costs, and expenses, including, but not limited to, those for any attorneys, experts, documents, and witnesses.</p>
<p><strong>H. Governing Law and Award: </strong>The arbitrator shall follow the substantive law of the State of Florida without regard to its conflicts of laws principles. Any award rendered shall include a confidential written opinion and shall be final, subject to appeal under the FAA. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
<p><strong>I. Enforceability: </strong>This provision survives termination of your account or relationship with Weiss Ratings, bankruptcy, assignment, or transfer. If the class action waiver is deemed unenforceable (i.e., unenforceability would allow arbitration to proceed as a class or representative action), then this entire arbitration provision shall be rendered null and void and shall not apply. If a portion of this arbitration provision (other than the class action waiver) is deemed unenforceable, the remaining portions of this arbitration provision shall remain in full force and effect.</p>
<p><strong>J. Miscellaneous: </strong>Failure or any delay in enforcing this arbitration provision in connection with any particular Claim will not constitute a waiver of any rights to require arbitration at a later time or in connection with any other Claims except all Claims must be brought within the 1 year limitation period set forth above. This provision is the entire arbitration agreement between you and Weiss Ratings and shall not be modified except in writing by Weiss Ratings.</p>

Should the changes to this arbitration provision be material, Weiss Ratings will provide you notice and an opportunity to opt-out. Your continued use of the Site, purchase of a product or service on or through the Site, or use or attempted use of a Weiss Ratings product or service, is affirmation of your consent to such material changes.</p>
